"Django is a Python-based web framework which allows you to quickly create web application without all of the installation or dependency problems that you normally will find with other frameworks. 

Django is based on MVT (Model View Template) architecture and revolves around CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) operations."


For my first Django project task from I4GxZuri training:

I created a new Python virtual environment.

Initialized it, and installed Django in it.

Then created a new Django project, using my ZuriBoard username as the name of the project.
